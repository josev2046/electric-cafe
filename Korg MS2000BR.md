## Korg MS2000BR: The Ultimate Quick Reference

An essential guide to maximising the potential of your 4-voice virtual analogue synthesiser.

### 1. Architecture at a Glance
* **Polyphony:** 4 voices (Mono, Poly, Unison).
* **Oscillators:** 2 per voice + Noise. OSC 1 features 7 waveforms (including 64 DWGS digital waves). OSC 2 features 3 waveforms plus Ring Modulation and Sync.
* **Filter:** Multi-mode resonant filter (24dB/octave Low Pass, 12dB/octave Low Pass, Band Pass, High Pass).
* **Envelopes:** 2 ADSR envelopes (EG 1 is hardwired to the Filter; EG 2 is hardwired to the Amp).
* **LFOs:** 2 independent Low-Frequency Oscillators (LFO 1 has 4 waveforms; LFO 2 has 2 waveforms).

### 2. The Virtual Patch System (Modulation Matrix)
This is where the heavy lifting happens. You have four virtual patches per timbre to route modulation sources to various destinations.

| Source (Modulator) | Destination (Target) | Expert Tip |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EG 1 / EG 2 | Pitch, Cutoff, Amp, Pan, LFO Freq | Brilliant for punchy brass swells or auto-panning effects. |
| LFO 1 / LFO 2 | Pitch, Cutoff, Amp, Pan, OSC 1 Ctrl | Route LFO 2 to OSC 1 Control for classic PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). |
| Velocity | Pitch, Cutoff, Amp | Absolutely essential for expressive, touch-sensitive playing. |
| Keyboard Track | Pitch, Cutoff, Amp, Pan | Use this to scale filter cutoff naturally across the keyboard. |

### 3. Mastering the Mod Sequence
The Mod Sequencer is your secret weapon. It is a 3-track, 16-step motion sequencer that automates parameter changes over time.

* **Track Setup:** Choose one of the three available tracks.
* **Destination:** Assign the track to a parameter (e.g., Pitch for melodies, Cutoff for acid basslines, Pan for stereo movement).
* **Step Resolution:** Adjust the step length (1 to 16 steps) to fit your groove.
* **Motion Type:** Select `Smooth` for continuous, sweeping transitions or `Step` for rigid, rhythmic jumps.
* **Synchronisation:** Ensure your `Clock` is set properly (Internal, or External MIDI) to lock the sequence to your DAW's tempo.

### 4. Setting Up the 16-Band Vocoder
The MS2000BR is highly regarded for its crisp, robotic vocoder capabilities.

* **Audio Routing:** Plug your microphone into Audio In 2 on the rear panel and ensure the Mic/Line switch is set to Mic.
* **Programme Setup:** Initialise a vocoder patch or select an existing vocoder programme from the factory banks.
* **The Carrier:** Play chords via MIDI to act as the synthetic carrier signal.
* **The Modulator:** Speak directly into the mic to shape the synth's sound.
* **Formant Shift:** Tweak the `Formant Shift` control to radically alter the vocal character from deep and villainous to squeaky and unnatural.
* **Stereo Spread:** Adjust the Filter Pan to spread the 16 bands across the stereo field for a massive, wide sound.

### 5. Effects and Equalisation
Do not overlook the onboard effects; they add vital colour and polish to the raw oscillators.

* **Modulation:** Choose between Chorus, Flanger, or Ensemble. The Ensemble effect instantly provides a lush, 80s string machine vibe.
* **Delay:** Options include Cross, L/R, or Ping-Pong. Sync the delay time to MIDI clock for perfect rhythmic echoes.
* **Distortion:** Engage the distortion circuit before the EQ for aggressive, biting leads and overdriven basses.
* **EQ:** A dedicated 2-band EQ (Low/High). Use it to roll off muddy low frequencies or add top-end sizzle.

### 6. Workflow Tips & Hidden Tricks

* **Initialise a Patch:** To start from a completely blank slate, press the `Global` button, navigate to the `Utility` menu, select `Init Prog`, and confirm.
* **Unison Mode:** Stack all 4 voices onto a single note for enormous, fat basslines (bear in mind this makes the synthesiser strictly monophonic).
* **Explore DWGS Waves:** Dive into the DWGS (Digital Waveform Generator System) waves on OSC 1 to access classic digital bell, electric piano, and organ tones lifted from the vintage Korg DW-8000.
* **Arpeggiator Sync:** Hit `Global`, navigate to the `MIDI Clock` page, and set it to `Ext` if you want the arpeggiator and delay effects to flawlessly follow your DAW's master tempo.
